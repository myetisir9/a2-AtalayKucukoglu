            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, put rice flour. Take a little bit (like half a cup or even one cup) from 1 lt. milk and stir it well, until you form a paste. This is only to mix rice flour with rest of the milk in an easier – otherwise I sometimes ended up with lumps.</li>
                <li>Put rest of the milk in a pan, add sugar, coconut flakes, ground almond and rice flour paste. Whisk a little.</li>
                <li>Put on medium heat and while constantly stirring, cook it until it gets thick.</li>
                <li>Once thick, take out of heat and divide between bowls using a ladle.</li>
                <li>Leave the bowls for a while on the counter, until they cool down close to room temperature. Then cover with stretch film and put in the fridge, for about 3-4 hours.</li>
                <li>Serve with coconut flakes or ground pistachios. Best served the same day, but if not, then leaving in the fridge overnight is still ok.</li>
