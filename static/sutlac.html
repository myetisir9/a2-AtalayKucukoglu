                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C).</li>
                <li>Wash the rice and place it in a large saucepan with enough water to cover it by about 1/2 inch. Bring it to a boil and reduce the heat. Let the rice simmer gently until the rice is soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 3 3/4 cups milk, the sugar, and vanilla extract to the rice. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it boil very gently for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using a whisk, mix together the remaining 1 cup milk and the cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth. While stirring, gradually pour this mixture into the rice. Turn up the heat and continue stirring the pudding until scalding.</li>
                <li>When the pudding thickens, continue to stir and cook for about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and fill small, ovenproof dessert cups, clay cups, or disposable aluminum pudding cups with the hot mixture.</li>
                <li>Using a spoon, drizzle a small amount of the egg yolk and milk mixture into the center of each dessert cup. With the back of the spoon, use a light, circular motion to swirl the egg yolk from the center to the edges so it spreads evenly over the top of each cup.</li>
                <li>Bake the pudding cups until the tops are nicely browned, about 20 minutes. Let the cups cool at room temperature and then refrigerate for several hours before serving.</li>
